\hspace{2em}Welcome to St. Peter's Church, Lutton place and welcome to our wedding. We're delighted that you are able to join us today, despite the danger and frustration that these times have wreaked upon us. Our hope was always that we would celebrate our unity with as many of our friends and family as possible, but given the issues that would now pose, we are more than happy to settle for you lot. 

\hspace{2em}The reduced numbers are, sadly, not the only way that today's celebrations will differ from our original plans. Due to the various restrictions that are in place (legal, and otherwise) there will be no sung hymns during the service (though do please feel free to hum into your mask), and our reception will be considerably diminished and ``spread out'' throughout the evening.

\section{Greeting} 

Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. \\

{\bf Amen.}

\section{Introduction} 
{\em President:} We have come together in the presence of God to witness the marriage of Rebecca and Adam, to celebrate their love for each other, and to ask God's blessing upon them.\\

Through the ages, people on great journeys have stopped at important places, and at decisive moments, to build cairns at the roadside to which they and others can always return.\\

Our life consists not only in being but also in becoming, it is a journey in which we grow and are transformed.\\

The great stories of God’s people and the coming of Jesus proclaim the faithfulness of God’s covenant and promise. God as Trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) reveals to us the very nature of love in relationship. Relationships give human life its purpose and direction.\\

Rebecca and Adam's relationship is a great journey that, in different ways, we have travelled and will continue to travel with them. Today we pause along the way to gather at a decisive and important moment for us all. They are to be married.\\

We mark this decisive moment in Rebecca and Adam's journey now, adding to the cairn the stones of our love, our support and our prayers for them as they make their promises.\\

Creating and Redeeming God,\newline
it is your love which draws us together.\newline
Through the love which we have for one another,\newline
may we also grow in love for you.\newline
Walking with Christ as our companion on the way,\newline
may we come to share the joy\newline
which you have prepared for all who love you;\newline
through Jesus Christ our Lord.\newline\newline
{\bf Amen.}

\section{The Liturgy of the Word}

{\em Reading:} Luke 12.22-31\\

{\em Sermon}\\

{\em Those who are to be married stand in front of the president.}\\

{\em President:}\\ O God, whom to follow is to risk our whole lives: as Ruth and Naomi loved and held to one another, abandoning the ways of the past, so may Rebecca and Adam not be divided, but travel together into that strange land where you will lead us through Jesus Christ.\\

{\bf Amen.}


\section{The Promises}

{\em Rebecca and Adam face each other. One of them takes the other’s right hand and says:}

Before God and our friends, I, N., give myself to you, N., in loving and lifelong marriage. I promise to be with you, in sorrow and in joy, in need and in plenty, in frailty and in strength. God keep me always true to this promise.\\

{\em They loose hands. The other takes the first’s right hand and says:}

Before God and our friends, I, N., give myself to you, N., in loving and lifelong marriage. I promise to be with you, in sorrow and in joy, in need and in plenty, in frailty and in strength. God keep me always true to this promise.\\

{\em They loose hands.}

\section{The Giving and Receiving of Rings}

{\em Rebecca and Adam face each other.}\\

{\em Adam places a ring on Rebecca's finger, saying:}\\
Rebecca, I give you this ring as I give you myself, all that I have, and all that I am.\\

{\em Rebecca places a ring on Adam's finger, saying:}\\
Adam, I give you this ring as I give you myself, all that I have, and all that I am.

\section{The Proclamation}

{\em As Rebecca and Adam continue to face each other, joining hands, the congregation says:}\\
{\bf We have witnessed the promises of Rebecca and Adam.
Together we now handsel\footnote{`Handsel' - an old Scots word, meaning 'a gift bestowed to commemorate an inaugural occasion, event or season'.} them.\\
As they are pledged to each other in love, so we promise, in hope, to be a living sign of love in the world.}\\

{\em The president says to Rebecca and Adam:}\\
Rebecca and Adam, now that you have made these\\ promises before God and before those gathered here, I declare that you are joined in marriage.\\
The peace of the Lord be with you.

\section{The Peace}

{\em The president says to the congregation:}\\
We meet in Christ's name.\\

{\em The congregation responds:}\\
{\bf Let us share his peace.}\\

All may exchange a sign of peace.\\

{\em Given the danger that the traditional method (a handshake) would presently pose, we request that all signs are non-contacting, and socially distanced.}

\section{The Registration} 

{\em The Registration takes place, in the sight of the congregation, at this point. We would respectfully request that guests remain in their alocated socially-distanced seats, but instead enjoy the incidental music played by our wonderful organist Sheila Chisholme.}

\section{The Prayer of Thanksgiving and Blessing}

{\em The President says:}\\
God of love and faithfulness, you give joy to bridegroom and to bride.\\
Uphold Rebecca and Adam in their marriage\\
and enfold them in your peace.\\
Give them wisdom and understanding\\
and sustain them in sickness and sorrow.\\
Teach them, throughout their life together,\\
the power of your promise, “You are blest.”\\


Rebecca and Adam, the blessing of God be upon you,\\
that good may come to you;\\
the blessing of Christ be upon you,\\
that good be done to you;\\
the blessing of the Holy Spirit be yours,\\
that good may be the course of your life,\\
each day of your arising, each night of your lying down,\\
for evermore.\\

{\bf Amen.}\\

As our Saviour Christ has commanded and taught us, we are bold to say:\\

{\bf Our Father,\\
who art in heaven,\\
hallowed be thy name;\\
thy kingdom come;\\
thy will be done;\\
on earth as it is in heaven.\\
Give us this day our daily bread;\\
and forgive us our trespasses,\\
as we forgive those\\
who trespass against us.\\
And lead us not into temptation,\\
but deliver us from evil.\\
For thine is the kingdom,\\
the power and the glory,\\
for ever and ever.\\
Amen.}

\section{Conclusion}

{\em President:} God of all the world, as you have called together Rebecca and Adam, so we have come together in your love.\\
 
As in your presence, Rebecca and Adam have promised to love each other, so we have promised to support them.\\

As Rebecca and Adam have declared their love for each other, may they declare your love for all the world.\\

As you have blessed Rebecca and Adam in their marriage, bless us now in our lives.
Make us, like them, a blessing to one another and to you. \\

Christ go before us to guide our steps  \\
Christ be within us to kindle our vision  \\
Christ shine from us to give joy to the world.  \\

{\em The newly-married lead the congregation from the church.}
